        <h3>Story and life events:</h3>
        <p>
            Even as a child, Hanuman had great powers. One morning, he saw the sun rising and thought it was 
            a great yellow ball. He decided to get hold of it so that he could play with it. Indra, the king of 
            gods, saw Hanuman leap into the sky and wanted to stop him. And how did he do that? He threw 
            his weapon, the Vajra (thunderbolt) at the child. Hanuman fell to earth, wounded.
        </p><img src="https://wiralfeed.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/sun-eater1.jpg" alt="Hanuman Eating Sun">
        <p>Hanuman’s enraged father decided to go on a strike until the one who hurt his child was punished. Imagine if there is no wind on earth! How would it be? No gentle cooling breeze when the sun blazes down. No power to move the rain-bearing clouds. Why, after a point, both humans and animals couldn’t breathe. Vayu’s strike made life on earth difficult.

            The gods knew they had to placate Vayu. So, they offered the baby a multitude of boons. Brahma said that no weapon would ever hurt Hanuman and that he would be able to change his form at will and travel wherever he chose. Indra’s boon was that the Vajra would no longer hurt the child and that his body would be stronger than the weapon. Varuna, the god of the ocean, offered him protection from water.
            
            Agni, the god of fire, blessed him with immunity to fire. Surya, the sun god, gave him the power to change the size of his body. Yama blessed him with good health and immortality. Vishwakarma, the divine architect, offered a boon that Hanuman would be safe from all objects of his creation.
            
            With all these boons, Hanuman became a great warrior who played a crucial role in the Ramayan.</p>

  <p> Rama and Lakshmana come across Hanuman and Sugriva, while they were wandering in the forests of Kishkindha searching for Sita, just after she had been abducted by Ravana. Sugriva, at first was suspicious about the identities of Rama and Lakshmana, and thinking them to be a spy, sent by his brother Vali. Hanuman, however was confident that those two cannot be Vali’s spies, as they looked like dignified warriors However, just to be double sure, Sugriva sent Hanuman in the guise of a Brahmin to inquire about their actual identities and the purpose of their visit. Rama, upon meeting with Hanuman was greatly impressed with his exemplary virtues of good manners, and his perfectly polished tone of speaking. Rama, in him saw the qualities of a trustworthy friend, whom he can depend on, especially at that hour of danger, when Sita was missing. When Rama finally introduces himself to Hanuman, Hanuman removes his disguise, and falls to the feet of Rama, seeking his blessings. This was beginning of an epic friendship between Rama and his greatest devotee. Even today, people quote their relationship as examples of the best ever friendship that was ever there in the history of Hindu mythology. Hanuman is very popularly depicted as opening his chest containing the picture of Rama and Sita. Hanuman, therefore stands to be the greatest devotee to be ever born on the Earth.

    Hanuman then introduces Rama to Sugriva, and explains to him the scenario with his brother, Vali. Rama helps Sugriva regain his kingdom from Vali, by killing Vali. In return Sugriva promises to provide Rama with an army of vanars, to assist Rama and Hanuman in finding Sita. He sent the vanars, in all four directions of the Earth to search for Sita. The vanars bring the news that Sita is in Lanka.

  <p> Hanuman reached Lanka, by making a giant leap across the ocean from the Indian land. Hanuman was really impressed with Lanka’s beauty and prosperity when he looked at it from the top. Hanuman finds Sita in captivity in the Ashoka groves. Hanuman pleads her to come back with him, to Rama, and assures her that he has been looking for her with all his efforts combined. However, Sita refused to go with Hanuman, as it would be an insult to Rama himself. She told Hanuman to give Rama the message that she would return only with Rama. Hanuman also gave Sita a ring given to her by Rama. After his meeting with Sita, all hell breaks loose in Lanka, and Hanuman began to create absolute havoc. He single handedly destroyed the palaces and properties of Lanka, and also kills many rakshasas, including Jambumali and Aksha Kumar. Hanuman also fakes getting caught to Ravana’s son, Indrajit, so as to meet with the evil himself, Ravana. When he met Ravana, he gave him an ultimatum to leave Sita, and he also undermined his strength by saying that he would forgive him, if he returns Sita honorably. This greatly enraged Ravana, and orders the burning of Hanuman’s tail. Hanuman, after letting it burn for a while, jumps from one roof to another, burning large parts of Lanka, while also escaping from his captors, after which he returned too Rama, by again leaping over the ocean back to India.

  <p>
    Lakshmana had been seriously injured during his battle against Ravana’s son, Indrajit. Rama sent Hanuman to fetch a potent life restoring herb,
     Sanjivani, from the Dronagiri Mountains in the Himalayas, using which Lakshmana’s health could be restored. Ravana, on hearing this, plans for Lakshmana’s death, as 
     that would get Rama too grief-stricken to be able to fight in a war. He dispatches the witch Kalanemi to disrupt Hanuman’s attempts of finding the herb on time. Kalanemi, in disguise, as a sage,
      initially succeeds in fooling Hanuman. However, Hanuman finds out the disguise with the help of an apsara, whom he released from her accursed state of a crocodile, and he then kills Kalanemi. Ravana, still doesn’t gives
       up on his attempts, and calls upon Surya to rise earlier than its schedule, Ravana knew that Lakshmana would succumb to his wounds if not treated till daybreak. Hanuman, on realizing this danger, transforms himself into many
        times his normal size, to prevent the Sun God to appear. And then as he continued his search for the precious herb, he realized that he was not being able to recognize the specific herb that was required to cure Lakshmana. So, as a solution to his problem he lifts the entire mountain, owing to his infinite strength, and places the mountain in the battlefield of Lanka, where Sushena, the physician identifies the herb and uses it successfully to redeem Lakshmana back to life. Rama was ever grateful to Hanuman, and warmly embraced Hanuman to save his dear brother. Hanuman,
     then released Surya from his powerful grip, and asked for his forgiveness, as Surya was his teacher.
